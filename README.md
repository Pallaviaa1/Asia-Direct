<!-- Important Note About AI Tools

We strongly encourage and prefer candidates who effectively use AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.) in their development workflow.

Using these tools demonstrates your ability to leverage modern resources efficiently, which is a skill we highly value in our team.


Technical Assignment: CAD File Block Viewer

Create a simple web application that allows users to view and interact with blocks from CAD files (DWG/DXF). This assignment tests your Node.js and PostgreSQL skills in a practical application.


Time Expectation

With effective use of AI coding assistants, this assignment should take approximately 3-5 hours to complete. We value efficient problem-solving and understand that AI tools can help streamline development.


Requirements

Backend (Node.js)

Create a Node.js application using Express.js
Set up a PostgreSQL database connection
Implement API endpoints to:
Upload and process CAD files using suggested libraries
Extract and store block data in PostgreSQL (focus on block names and coordinates)
Retrieve list of blocks with pagination
Get detailed properties of a selected block
Search/filter blocks by name or type
User authentication is NOT required for this assignment

Frontend

Create a simple interface that allows users to:
Upload CAD files from their computer OR use a file downloaded from https://dwgmodels.com/
View a list of extracted blocks
Select blocks to view their properties
Search/filter blocks
You may implement the frontend using either:
HTML/CSS with vanilla JavaScript
React (or other frontend framework of your choice)
No need to implement complex geometry rendering - a simple display of block data is sufficient

Database (PostgreSQL)

Create tables to store:
File information (name, upload date, etc.)
Block data (name, coordinates, and any other basic properties you can extract)
Implement appropriate queries to retrieve block data

File Format Clarification

You are free to choose either DWG or DXF format for your implementation
If using DXF is easier with available libraries, that is perfectly acceptable
Focus on successfully extracting basic block information rather than handling all CAD features

Technical Constraints (All Mandatory)

Use Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL
Use an ORM like Sequelize or TypeORM (provide reasoning for your choice)
Implement proper error handling with appropriate status codes and messages
Implement input validation for all API endpoints
Document all API endpoints
Write at least 2 unit tests for critical functions

Recommended Libraries

We recommend using the following libraries to simplify CAD file processing:

dxf-parser for parsing DXF files
three-dxf for visualization (optional)
OR any other library you find suitable (explain your choice)

Note: We understand that working with CAD files can be complex. Focus on implementing the basic functionality of extracting and displaying block information. The solution doesn't need to be perfect - we're primarily assessing your coding skills, approach to problem-solving, and ability to work with Node.js and PostgreSQL.


Deliverables

Source code in a GitHub repository
SQL scripts for creating your database tables
README with:
Setup instructions
API documentation
Explanation of your database schema
Reasoning behind library choices
Challenges faced and how you overcame them
How you used AI coding assistants in your development process
A short video (2-3 minutes) demonstrating your application functionality
Sample Data

You can download sample CAD files from https://dwgmodels.com/ for testing purposes. Select simple files that contain multiple blocks for the best demonstration.


Evaluation Criteria

Functionality: Does the application extract and display block data?
Code Quality: Is the code well-structured and maintainable?
Database Design: Is the database schema appropriate?
Error Handling: How well does the application handle edge cases?
Documentation: Is the solution well-documented?
AI Tool Usage: How effectively you leveraged AI assistants in your development

Submission

Please submit your GitHub repository link and video demonstration to [recruiting email] with the subject line "CAD Block Viewer Assignment - Pallavi Singh " before the 15th of Apr'25.


We understand that you may have other commitments, so please let us know if you need more time to complete the assignment.

We look forward to reviewing your solution!
